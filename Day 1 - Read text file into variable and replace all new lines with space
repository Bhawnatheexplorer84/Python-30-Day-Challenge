Hint--
##
First, open the file in a read mode
Next, read all content from a file using the read() function and assign it to a variable.
Next, use string replace() function to replace all newlines (\n) with space (' ').
Display final string

---with: This is a context manager in Python. It simplifies resource management (like file handling) by acquiring and releasing resources automatically. 
When the indented block inside the with statement is entered, the file is opened, and when the block is exited, the file is automatically closed.
-----open('sample.txt', 'r'): This function is used to open a file named 'sample.txt' in read mode ('r'). The second argument 'r' indicates that the file is opened for reading. 
  If the file does not exist or cannot be opened, it will raise a FileNotFoundError.
---as file: This assigns the opened file object to the variable file. 
This variable can be used to perform operations on the file, such as reading its contents.

---So, the purpose of this line is to open the file named 'sample.txt' for reading, create a context in which the file is open, and assign the file object to the variable file. 
Once the indented block under with is executed, the file will be automatically closed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.

with open ('sample.txt', 'r') as file:
  data = file.read().replace('\n', ' ')
  print(data)
