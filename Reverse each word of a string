#Reverse each word of the string#
** Hint **

** Use split() method to split a string into a list of words
** Reverse each word from a list
** Use join to combine all words of the list
## Slicing is a powerful technique for extracting portions of sequences (such as strings, lists, or tuples). The syntax for slicing is start:stop:step, where:
start: The index at which the slice begins (inclusive).
stop: The index at which the slice ends (exclusive).
step: The step size between elements......
start defaults to the beginning, stop defaults to the end, and step defaults to 1. 
sequence[::-1]

def reverse_words(Sentence):        # defining a function called reverse_words that takes a parameter Sentence.
   words = Sentence.split(" ")      # split string on whitespace
# iterate list and reverse each word using ::-1   
new_word_list = [word[::-1] for word in words]
# Joining the new list of words
res_str = " ".join(new_word_list)
return(res_str)

# Given String
str1 = "My Name is Jessa"
print(reverse_words(str1))
